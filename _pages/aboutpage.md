I am a newly minted data scientist (on top of being a regular scientist), and this is where I show off all my cool projects!

[insert cool story here]

I have two amazing, fluffy good boys, Bart and Blue. One of my favourite things to do is to take them to the beach for a long swim and splash in the water.

## SentimentSmart

SentimentSmart is an app that predicts positive, negative and neutral emotions based on sentences.

SentimentSmart performs with 92% accuracy on previously seen sentences and with 78% accuracy on completely unseen sentences.

Practically, SentimentSmart can be used to analyse the sentiments of tweets on a variety of topics, or, in a retail setting, it can be used to generate critical customer satisfaction insights. SentimentSmart is not only able to detect sentiment, it also tells you which parts of the sentence contributed to the insight.

Here, I have used it to analyse whether the daily sentiment was positive, negative, or neutral for the 20 most tweet-abundant locations around the world on the topic of COVID-19.
